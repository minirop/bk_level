bk_levels
=========

* Open the desired level in Banjo's Backpack
* Close BB
* Grab the file(s) in <BB>/tmp/
	* To know which files, look in <BB>/resources/setups.xml (`modelAPointer` and `modelBPointer` of the desired level)
* Copy them somewhere else
* Rename them to <name>.lvl.bin
* Execute the programme with <name>.lvl.bin as the sole argument
* You'll get .obj, .mtl, and .png files
